decay mode of a fundemental particle
first observed a few years ago
list main things in mc
follow theme of thesis

show peak
show my bgc data
jeff's analysis
overlay two results
mc + overlay

emphasize my work
half-hour at most - 15-20 slides

update figure on slide 4

electron capture, nuclear beta decay, took more than 70 yrs to observe in neutron, calculable within sm, continous spectrum of photons, leverage for physics beyond sm
slide 2

list steps of signal analysis - no pictures?
slide explaining trace back
filter, smooth, parameters
captions on signal analysis

slide for MC, before slide 17
